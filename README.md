Social media sentiment analysis 

Social media has been initially found to be a great platform of connecting people from all over the world and still remained in top position as a virtual medium among netzines however most of the media platforms (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram) over the years have been commercialized and democratized as well and that leads to an interesting research area where users opinions or participation can impact an organization’s or brand’s reputation in no time. Analyze unstructured users’ opinion or text in twitter platform and predict sentiments and discovering relations between part of text with sentiments using artificial intelligence algorithms known as deep learnings are the objectives of this paper. Successful AI model can work independently across different media platforms to predict users view or judgements, fake news, hate speech propagation etc.
